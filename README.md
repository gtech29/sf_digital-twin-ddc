# Digital Twin for DDC (Direct Digital Control) System

This project simulates a Direct Digital Control (DDC) system using containerized components. It virtualizes physical elements like sensors, a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), and a real-time dashboard. Designed for experimentation, development, and future deployment using Kubernetes.

---

## Architecture Overview

```
[ Sensor ] ---> [ MQTT Broker ] ---> [ PLC ] ---> [ Dashboard UI ]
     │                                     ↑
     └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

All components communicate over a custom Docker bridge network (`twin-net`) using MQTT. The setup is fully containerized using Docker and can be orchestrated via Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** — service logic
- **Docker** — containerization
- **MQTT (Mosquitto)** — messaging protocol
- **Flask + Flask-SocketIO** — real-time web dashboard
- **Chart.js** — temperature graphing
- **Kubernetes (K8s)** — for orchestration (included under `/K8s`)

## How to Run It Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-twin-ddc.git
cd digital-twin-ddc
```

### 2. Build and Launch Containers

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will start:
- A simulated temperature sensor
- An MQTT broker (Mosquitto)
- A PLC that reacts to incoming data
- A dashboard for real-time monitoring

### 3. View the Dashboard

Open your browser to:  
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### 4. (Optional) Send Test MQTT Message

```bash
docker exec -it mqtt-broker mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t sensors/temperature -m "24.7"
```
